# Overview

Components are the building blocks of your slides. They are elements that make it easy to add content to your slides.

- `x(float $x)` - Sets the x position of the component.
- `y(float $y)` - Sets the y position of the component.
- `position(float $x, float $y)` - Sets the x and y position of the component.
- `width(int $width)` - Sets the width of the component.
- `height(int $height)` - Sets the height of the component.
